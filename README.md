Tao Lin wrote a serires of articles about North American Hamsters and published them on the web. This repository is a
typeset version of the articles, designed to be printed out on paper. I did not ask Tao for permission to do this, but he
[seemed cool with it](https://github.com/afader/north-american-hamsters/raw/master/tao.jpg) (photo by Allison Reibel).
**I did not write any of this except for the front/back matter. All rights belong to Tao Lin.**
